# DevHealth - Local-First Development Environment Monitor

A tool that embodies the "fix your tools" philosophy by automatically detecting and suggesting fixes for broken development environments.

## Philosophy

Inspired by Adolfo Ochagavía's insight: developers often work around broken tools instead of fixing them first. DevHealth helps identify these issues before they slow you down.

## Features

- 🔍 **Environment Health Scanning**: Automatically detect issues with Python, Node, Docker, Git, and more
- ⚡ **Performance Monitoring**: Identify bottlenecks in your development workflow  
- 🔧 **Fix Suggestions**: Get actionable recommendations to resolve issues
- 🏠 **Local-First**: Works entirely offline with no external dependencies
- 🔌 **Extensible**: Plugin system for adding support for new tools

## Quick Start

```bash
cd devhealth
python src/devhealth.py scan
```

Built in 2026 with ❤️ for the developer community.
